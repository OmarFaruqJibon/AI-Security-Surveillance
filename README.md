# 🔒 Smart Security System – YOLO + InsightFace  

A real-time **AI-powered security system** that combines **YOLO (object detection)** with **InsightFace (face recognition)** to monitor restricted areas.  
- Detects when someone enters a **restricted zone**.  
- **Recognizes known faces** (authorized users).  
- **Triggers alarms + sends email alerts** when an **unknown person** is detected.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🎯 **Restricted-area monitoring** using YOLO.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Face recognition with InsightFace** (buffalo_l model).  
- 🔔 **Alarm system** (short beep pulses).  
- 📩 **Email alerts with snapshots** of intruders.  
- 🖼️ **Real-time video display** with bounding boxes and labels.  
- 🚀 Works fully on **CPU** (no GPU required).  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) – person detection.  
- [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) – face recognition.  
- OpenCV – video stream processing.  
- NumPy – math operations.  
- cvzone – easy OpenCV utilities.  
- Python standard libs: threading, smtplib, winsound, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-security-system.git
cd smart-security-system
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate virtual environment  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Add your known faces  
- Place clear **frontal images** of authorized users inside `known_faces/`.  
- Use filenames as their names (e.g., `John.jpg` → "John").  

### 5️⃣ Run the system  
```bash
python main_security_system.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration  

- **Restricted Area**: Update polygon coordinates inside `main_security_system.py`.  
- **Email Alerts**: Update `EMAIL_SENDER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, and `EMAIL_RECEIVER`.  
- **YOLO Model**: Replace `models/yolov8s.pt` with your trained/custom model if needed.  
- **Thresholds**: Adjust face recognition similarity threshold inside code for stricter/looser matching.  

---

## 📧 Email Alert Example  

When an **unknown person** enters the restricted area:  
- A **beeping alarm** is triggered.  
- A snapshot (`detected.jpg`) is saved.  
- An **email with the snapshot attached** is sent automatically.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Add database for **logging intruder history**.  
- Cloud integration (send alerts to Telegram/Slack).  
- Add GPU support for faster processing.  
- Support multi-camera setups.
